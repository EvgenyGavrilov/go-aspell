# Aspell library bindings for Go

## Getting started

First make sure aspell library and headers are installed on your system. On Debian/Ubuntu you could install it this way:

```
sudo apt-get install aspell, libaspell-dev
```

It you need some more dictionaries you can install them like this:

```
sudo apt-get install aspell-ua aspell-se
```

Then you can install the package using the Go tool:

```
go get github.com/trustmaster/go-aspell
```

## Usage

Examples will be added later, for now see aspell_test.go source.
